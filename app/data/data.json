The undersides and sides may appear mottled with light coloured circular scars caused by various types of parasites, including scars from the bite of the 'cookie-cutter' shark ( Isistius brasiliensis) (Aguilar 2002).At sexual maturity, sei whales are approximately 12-16 m long, although they can reach lengths of 17.7 m in males and 21 m in females (Gambell 1985). Adult females are about 0.5-0.6 m longer than males, and sei whales of the Southern Hemisphere are larger than those of the Northern Hemisphere (Horwood 1987). The body of the sei whale is slim, streamlined and laterally compressed in the caudal (hind) region.Sounds of the sei whale consist of a series of short pulses with peak energy in the 1.5-3.5 kHz range (Richardson et al. 1995). During a recent Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (SO-GLOBEC) cruise, acoustic recordings accompanied by photographs and acoustic tracking of a group of sei whales feeding in the Western Antarctic Peninsula provided the first confirmed description of sei whale sounds. Vocalisations included a series of \"growly\" type calls, with tonal calls having abrupt shifts in a much lower dominant frequency (~200-400 Hz) (McDonald & Thiele 2004, pers. comm.).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Sei_whale_mother_and_calf_Christin_Khan_NOAA.jpg","Image Author":"Christin Khan"},{"Scientific Name":"Balaenoptera musculus","Common Name":"Blue Whale","Threatened status":"Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":36,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Mammalia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=36","Family":"Balaenopteridae","Genus":"Balaenoptera","Species":"musculus","Description":"Both the Antarctic blue whale and pygmy blue whale have common phenotypic traits such as grey skin with mottled patterns, which enables identification of individuals. When submerged, the blue whale appears to be a luminous pale blue or aqua. They have a pronounced 'splashguard' in front of their blowholes, with a single pronounced longitudinal ridge leading forward on the rostrum. Their blow is tall and powerful (approximately 10 m). They have a long, smooth back with a small, variably-shaped dorsal fin set towards the tail (Jefferson et al. 1993). Differences between the two subspecies were first determined by whaling catches in the austral summer feeding season (Attard et al. 2010).Differences between the pygmy blue whale and the Antarctic blue whale include:<ul>\r<li><strong>Morphology</strong>: the Antarctic blue whale is the largest of the two subspecies growing to maximum lengths of over 30 m; in comparison, the pygmy blue whale is recorded growing to 24.1 m (Branch et al. 2009, Attard et al. 2010). Despite this difference, determining subspecies in the field can be difficult (Branch et al. 2009)</li>\r<li><strong>Vocalisations/acoustic calls</strong>: both subspecies produce distinctive acoustic calls that can be used to identify each species as well as provide insight into geographic and seasonal distributions (Stafford et al. 2004, 2011).</li>\r<li><strong>Genetics</strong>: both subspecies are genetically distinct, however diagnostic genetic markers are not available (LeDuc et al. 2007, Attard et al. 2012). The Antarctic and pygmy blue whale have been known to hybridise (Attard et al. 2012).</li>\r<li><strong>Austral summer distribution</strong>: the pygmy blue whale is typically found in more northern areas (north of 54&deg; S) at lower latitudes, throughout the Indian Ocean, whereas the Antarctic blue whale is usually found further south of Australia (60&deg; S), circumpolar wide (Branch et al. 2009, Attard et al. 2010).</li>\r</ul>Blue whale and fin whale hybrids has been documented in five cases (B&eacute;rub&eacute; & Aguilar 1998; Cipriano & Palumbi 1999; Spilliaert et al. 1991).

The undersides of the flippers and flukes are also white. The head is asymmetrical in colour and is mostly dark but the right lower jaw is white. Baleen plates are black on the left jaw and white on the right jaw. The body is free of mottling or extensive scarring (Leatherwood & Reeves 1983).The fin whale is the second-largest whale species, after the blue whale ( Balaenoptera musculus). Adult whales range between 20 and 27 m long and weigh more than 70 tonnes. As with other baleen whales, female fin whales grow to a larger size than males (Aguilar & Lockyer 1987). The fin whale is very streamlined in appearance, with a distinct ridge along the back behind the dorsal fin. The dorsal fin is set two-thirds of the way along the back, and is up to 60 cm tall, curved and often slopes backwards (Leatherwood & Reeves 1983).Fin whales are more gregarious than other baleen whales, and often occur in groups of 6-10, though single animals and pairs are more common. Aggregations of over 100 whales may be observed on feeding grounds (Watkins et al. 1987).Recordings of regular, pulsed sounds, seemingly of mechanical origin, attracted considerable military interest in the 1950s, and eventually these sounds were conclusively linked to sightings of fin whales (Schevill et al. 1964). Fin whale sounds are mostly 20 Hz or 22 Hz and are short, low-frequency tonal sequences (Nieukirk et al. 2004). Pulsed sounds include a \"rumble\" which is a call of very long duration (about 30 seconds), in the frequency range of 10-30 Hz with extensive frequency and amplitude modulation. The association of these sounds with the reproductive season suggests that they may be used in reproductive displays by males (Watkins et al. 1987).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Finhval_%281%29.jpg/1597px-Finhval_%281%29.jpg","Image Author":"Aqqa Rosing-Asvid"},{"Scientific Name":"Megaptera novaeangliae","Common Name":"Humpback Whale","Threatened status":"Vulnerable","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":38,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Mammalia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=38","Family":"Balaenopteridae","Genus":"Megaptera","Species":"novaeangliae","Description":"The humpback whale is a moderately large baleen whale. The maximum recorded length is 17.4 m, and females are generally 1.0-1.5 m longer than males (Chittleborough 1965). Southern Hemisphere humpback whales generally have a greater degree of white colouration on their ventral surface compared to darker Northern Hemisphere whales but there is no genetic evidence to support the need for subspecies status (Baker et al. 1990). The humpback whale has distinctive markings on the ventral side and trailing edge of their flukes as well as on their dorsal fins and flanks that are used for individual identification (Katona et al. 1979; Kniest et al. 2010). Their dorsal fin is distinctive from other balaenopterid whales as they have a hump on the leading edge of their dorsal fin.The humpback whale produces a variety of sounds throughout their habitat range. These sounds can be used for foraging, when in distress and in non-mating, social circumstances (Clapham 2000). The most studied vocalisations are songs produced by solitary males. The song frequency ranges from less than 20 Hz to 8 kHz (Payne & McVay 1971; Tyack 1981). A whale can sing for a period of minutes to hours and the song can vary over a range of frequencies with more powerful parts of the song audible over several kilometres underwater (Cato 1991). The exact function of male humpback whale song has yet to be determined but it is believed to be an integral part of male behaviour as a form of sexual display (Tyack 1981). Feeding ground song has only recently been recorded from a Southern Ocean Antarctic feeding area, where song transmission has been hypothesised as a form of cultural transmission between the neighbouring South Pacific populations (Garland et al. 2013).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Humpback_Whale_underwater_shot.jpg","Image Author":null},{"Scientific Name":"Eubalaena australis","Common Name":"Southern Right Whale","Threatened status":"Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":40,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Mammalia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=40","Family":"Balaenidae","Genus":"Eubalaena","Species":"australis","Description":"The southern right whale\u00cais a\u00calarge baleen whale with a less streamlined shape than balaenopterids like the\u00cahumpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae). They grow to a maximum length of 17.5 m and weight of 80 t, with mature females often slightly larger than males (Bannister et al. 1996). The mean length of sexually mature females off the South African coast was calculated as 13.85 m (Best & Ruther 1992) and off Argentina as 13.66 m (Whitehead & Payne 1981). Mature females in Soviet catches from the Southern Ocean averaged 14.34 m (Tormosov et al. 1998). Southern Right Whales are about 5.5 m long and 1000-1500 kg at birth and physical maturity is reached at a length of 16 m (Bannister et al. 1996). Age at physical maturity is unknown (Bannister et al. 1996). The vast majority of southern right whale individuals\u00caare uniformly black in colour, often with a white ventral blaze of varying size and shape centred on the umbilicus. About 2.8 % of adults are mottled dark brown to grey, having been white with varying degrees of black marking at birth (Bannister 1990). A small number of adults (1.4-3.4 %) have white dorsal blazing (Bannister 1990). The pectoral fins are short and paddle like, the flukes are uniform in colour with smooth trailing edges, and there is no dorsal fin. A distinctive feature is the presence of whitish or yellowish callosities on the rostrum, chin and lower jaw. These are formed as roughened patches of keratinised skin and colonised by cyamids (small crustaceans known as 'whale lice') (Cummings 1985a). Callosity patterns are present at birth and persist with minor variation through life, such that individual southern right whales can be identified by the number and configuration of callosities (Payne et al. 1983). They provide the basis for studies relying on an ability to recognise individuals from natural markings over long time frames (Best 1990e; Burnell & Bryden 1997; Payne 1986). The southern right whale head\u00cais large compared to body size and the jaw line strongly arched (Jefferson et al. 1993). Baleen plates number from 205-270 and the baleen is usually, dark, very fine, and long (maximum 2.2 m) in comparison to other species (Cummings 1985a).

The sexes generally appear alike, but some females can have a duller colouration that makes them difficult to distinguish from immature males (Higgins & Peter 2002).Juvenile birds can be distinguished from the adults on the basis of their much browner plumage and streaked underbody. Immature birds can be distinguished from the adults when in their first or, less often, in their second plumage by their duller colouration (although immature males can appear similar to dull-coloured adult females) (Higgins & Peter 2002).The Red-lored Whistler is usually seen singly or in twos.

The bird has noticeable breeding, non-breeding and juvenile plumages (Higgins & Davies 1996).<strong>Breeding plumage</strong>When breeding, the head and neck feathers are blackish-brown in the centre, giving a streaked pattern over a whitish background. The cap is dark, supercillum (area above eye) poorly marked and lores (area below eye) are white above with a diffuse area of brown. The chin, throat, belly, vent area and underwing are white; breast and flanks are white with a central band of black at each feather end forming an almost solid black centre to the breast. The flanks and undertail can show heart-shaped black spots. The back is blackish-brown with pale grey tips. Across the scapular feathers, central feathers have large chestnut ovals forming a chestnut band across the wings when folded. Covert feathers over primary wing feathers are grey with dark streaks and whitish fringes. The rump and upper tail coverts are white and sparsely marked with black and the tail is dark grey (Hayman et al. 1986; Higgins & Davies 1996).<strong>Non-breeding plumage</strong>During the non-breeding season, the Great Knot is paler and greyer above and on the breast. The breast is more finely streaked than spotted, flanks become sparsely streaked and the undertail is white. The head and upper parts have clear streaks of blackish-grey; most evident on crown and hindneck. Scapulars, wing coverts and mantle feathers are grey-brown with black-brown shaft streaks and edged in white giving a scalloped appearance (Geering et al. 2007; Hayman et al. 1986; Higgins & Davies 1996).<strong>Juvenile plumage</strong>Juveniles are darker and more brown than non-breeding adults; the mantle and scapulars being darkish brown with narrow whitish-buff fringes, giving a scalloped pattern similar to non-breeding adults. Coverts and tertial feathers are paler brown, with whitish-buff fringes and dark brown subterminal bands on the larger feathers. The crown is darker forming a distinct cap.

In breeding plumage, the male has a grey-brown crown and nape with a pale chestnut tinge, and a chestnut hindneck and sides of neck; the rest of the upperparts are pale grey-brown, with rufous edges to the feathers which impart a slightly scaled appearance, white sides of the rump and uppertail-coverts, and the tail has a blackish-brown subterminal band. In flight the upperwings feature blackish flight feathers and primary coverts with a narrow white trailing edge to the innerwing and a prominent white wing-bar; the inner wing coverts are grey brown, concolorous with most of the upperparts. The face has a black band across the upper forehead, and is white on the lower forehead; a black stripe runs back from the bill, widening to form a black mask across the eyes and ear coverts, and joins the narrow black band on the upper forehead. The chin and throat are white, bordered by the chestnut of the sides of the neck; there is a broad chestnut band across the upper breast (concolorous with the sides of the neck), and this sometimes has a narrow dark band on its upper edge; the rest of the underparts are white.

The eyebrow is pale and the chin and throat are white. The breast is chestnut and merges into the hindneck and the sides of the neck. It is demarcated from the throat by a narrow black band, with a narrow black line which extends down from the mask. The rest of the underbody is white.

As with other members of the legless lizard family, Striped Legless Lizards lack forelimbs and have only very reduced hind limbs. These hind limbs are apparent only as small flaps on either side of the vent. Superficially, these animals resemble snakes, but can be readily distinguished from the latter by the presence of external ear openings, a fleshy undivided tongue and a tail which is longer than the body (Cogger 1992). Striped Legless Lizards can be readily distinguished from other legless lizards by body colouration, body size and head scalation.The Striped Legless Lizard is a pale-grey lizard up to 30 cm in length, with a maximum snout-vent length (SVL) of about 12 cm. Striped Legless Lizards have a long thin body and the tail, when unbroken, is about twice the length of the body. They have a series of stripes on their sides and the sides of their back, becoming diagonal bands on the tail (Cogger 1992; Wilson & Knowles 1988). These stripes are dark-brown or blackish and extend the whole length of the individual from the neck to the tail. Each stripe has individual black-centered scales. However, in some individuals, particularly juveniles, these stripes may be very faint or absent. The head is generally darker than the body, tending to black in juveniles. The underside of Striped Legless Lizards is whitish and they have a blunt snout (Cogger 2000). The sexes of Striped Legless Lizards appear very similar externally. However, adult males may be distinguished by the presence of a small rounded 'spur' under each hind limb flap (M.A. Rauhala 1998, pers. comm.).There is significant variation in the size of Striped Legless Lizards in different populations in Victoria. A study at Dashwood found the modal size class to be 6.0 -6.9 g, while a study at Derrimut Grassland Reserve reported the modal size class to be 3.0 -4.1 g (Coulson 1990; Kutt 1992). The modal size class of Striped Legless Lizards captured at the Keilor Plains site was 6.0 -6.9 g. Some generations (size classes) appeared to be uncommon, suggesting that recruitment may be low in some years (O'Shea 1996). Observations of captive animals suggest that Striped Legless Lizards may skip reproduction when not in prime condition (J. Birkett n.d., pers. comm., cited in O'Shea 1996).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Striped_legless_lizard.jpg/440px-Striped_legless_lizard.jpg","Image Author":"Benjamint444"},{"Scientific Name":"Aprasia parapulchella","Common Name":"Pink-tailed Worm-lizard, Pink-tailed Legless Lizard","Threatened status":"Vulnerable","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":1665,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Reptilia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1665","Family":"Pygopodidae","Genus":"Aprasia","Species":"parapulchella","Description":null,"Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Pink-tailed_Worm-lizard_%28Aprasia_parapulchella%29_%289105308465%29.jpg/440px-Pink-tailed_Worm-lizard_%28Aprasia_parapulchella%29_%289105308465%29.jpg","Image Author":"Matt"},{"Scientific Name":"Caretta caretta","Common Name":"Loggerhead Turtle","Threatened status":"Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":1763,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Reptilia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1763","Family":"Cheloniidae","Genus":"Caretta","Species":"caretta","Description":null,"Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Loggerhead_sea_turtle.jpg/1600px-Loggerhead_sea_turtle.jpg","Image Author":"Ukanda"},{"Scientific Name":"Chelonia mydas","Common Name":"Green Turtle","Threatened status":"Vulnerable","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":1765,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Reptilia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1765","Family":"Cheloniidae","Genus":"Chelonia","Species":"mydas","Description":null,"Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Green_turtle_swimming_over_coral_reefs_in_Kona.jpg/1600px-Green_turtle_swimming_over_coral_reefs_in_Kona.jpg","Image Author":"Brocken Inaglory"},{"Scientific Name":"Eretmochelys imbricata","Common Name":"Hawksbill Turtle","Threatened status":"Vulnerable","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":1766,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Reptilia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1766","Family":"Cheloniidae","Genus":"Eretmochelys","Species":"imbricata","Description":"Hawksbill Turtles have a parrot-like beak.

Growling Grass Frogs vary in colour and pattern but in general are olive to bright emerald green, with irregular gold, brown, black or bronze spotting. Their backs are warty and usually have a pale green mid-dorsal stripe. The eardrum is pronounced. A cream or yellow stripe underlined by a dark brown stripe runs from the nostril, through the eye, above the inner ear and down the sides of the body to the groin as a dorso-lateral fold (Barker & Grigg 1977, Robinson 1993). On their bellies, Growling Grass Frogs are white and coarsely granular. During the breeding season males may become yellow or dark grey/black under the throat. The groin and posterior of the thighs are turquoise blue (DEC NSW 2005).Growling Grass Frogs lack webbing on their fingers but the toes are almost fully webbed. Toe discs are small and approximately equal in width to the digits. These frogs possess small vomerine teeth that are attached to a bone in the roof of the mouth and are situated between the internal openings of the nostrils in the roof of the mouth. These teeth are used for holding prey, which is then swallowed whole (Barker et al. 1995).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Litoria_raniformisA.JPG/440px-Litoria_raniformisA.JPG","Image Author":null},{"Scientific Name":"Litoria booroolongensis","Common Name":"Booroolong Frog","Threatened status":"Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":1844,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Amphibia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1844","Family":"Hylidae","Genus":"Litoria","Species":"booroolongensis","Description":"The Booroolong Frog is a medium sized tree frog.

It is a small, inconspicuous plant with pale coloured flowers. In winter this species develops a rosette of six to 10 basal leaves (10 -20 mm long and 6 -9 mm wide), which are shrivelled by the time the flowers mature. Three or four stem-sheathing bract-like leaves form above the rosette leaves (Bickerton & Robertson 2000a; NSW DECC 2005m).The flower stem grows to 30 -80 mm tall and has scaly bracts. One to six flowers are produced during November, of which only four open at a time. Flowers are pale, grey-green to brownish and up to 15 mm long on relatively long, slender, curved pedicels that spread widely from the stalk. The dorsal sepal and petals are combined into a hooded, column-embracing structure (the galea). The Lowly Greenhood hood and lateral sepals are tapered into long narrow pointed tips and flowers are placed near the ground due to curvature of the flower stalks. The lateral sepals are joined in the lower part and reflexed against the ovary (Bickerton & Robertson 2000a; NSW DECC 2005m).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Pterostylis_despectans.jpg/440px-Pterostylis_despectans.jpg","Image Author":"Russell Stanley"},{"Scientific Name":"Swainsona murrayana","Common Name":"Slender Darling-pea, Slender Swainson, Murray Swainson-pea","Threatened status":"Vulnerable","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":6765,"Kingdom":"Plantae","Class":"Magnoliopsida","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=6765","Family":"Fabaceae","Genus":"Swainsona","Species":"murrayana","Description":"The Slender Darling-pea is a prostrate, ascending to erect perennial herb growing up to 25 cm tall with densely pubescent stems (Harden 1991; Jeanes 1996).

Greenhood orchids share other characteristics such as; they grow in the ground; have fleshy tubers which are replaced each year; have a rosette of leaves which they shed each year; and are pollinated by male fungus gnats and mosquitoes (insects of the families Mycetophilidae and Culicidae respectively) (Bishop 1996).The Leafy Greenhood is distinctive amongst the Greenhood orchids because of its large fleshy leaves that are typically in a loose rosette surrounding the stem and large flowers (30 -40 mm long) with bright reddish-brown colourations in the sinus and hood (Jones et al. 1999).Floral StructuresLeafy Greenhoods produce a single, semi-nodding greenhood up to 40 mm long and 12 -15 mm wide (Bramwells 1993). This hood is translucent white with green stripes on top (the dorsal sepal), whilst the sides of the hoods (petals) are a reddish-chocolate brown. The lower part of the flower resembles a fork-like structure due to a deep notch between the chocolate brown lateral sepals (Jones 1998d).Distinctive features of this species' flower include that the hood is erect for &#190; of its length and then curves forward (downward) in a semicircle and ends in a blunt point (Backhouse & Jeanes 1995; Jones et al. 1999) and that the modified petal (labellum) appears as a short brown tongue within the hood (Backhouse & Jeanes 1995). In the related species  P. sp. aff.  cucullata (Barrington Tops) the top of the hood is horizontal and does not curve downward like the Leafy Greenhood, and has a broader, more strongly curved labellum (Bishop 1996).Vegetative CharactersThe Leafy Greenhood has a thick, basal rosette of three to seven fleshy dark green leaves that can appear cabbage-like (Backhouse & Jeanes 1995; Jones et al. 1999). In Tasmania, the leaves have also been recorded growing up the stem (Jones et al. 1999). Plants are deciduous and become dormant during summer (Dell & Bester 2006).Tubers of Leafy Greenhoods from Mornington Peninsula populations can grow up to 19 mm and produce replacement tubers each year, irrespective of whether the plant has produced leaves during that season (Mawson pers comm., as cited in Dell & Bester 2006). Leafy Greenhoods from Mornington Peninsula have shown that there is a relationship between tuber size and re-shooting/flowering time, with larger tubers shooting earlier (Dell & Bester 2006).","Image":"https://data.rbg.vic.gov.au/cip/preview/image/library/124617?maxsize=1024","Image Author":"Jeff Jeanes "},{"Scientific Name":"Brachyscome muelleroides","Common Name":"Mueller Daisy","Threatened status":"Vulnerable","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":15572,"Kingdom":"Plantae","Class":"Magnoliopsida","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=15572","Family":"Asteraceae","Genus":"Brachyscome","Species":"muelleroides","Description":null,"Image":"https://data.rbg.vic.gov.au/cip/preview/image/library/78866?maxsize=1024","Image Author":"Neville Walsh"},{"Scientific Name":"Caladenia hastata","Common Name":"Melblom's Spider-orchid","Threatened status":"Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":16118,"Kingdom":"Plantae","Class":"Liliopsida","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=16118","Family":"Orchidaceae","Genus":"Caladenia","Species":"hastata","Description":null,"Image":"https://data.rbg.vic.gov.au/cip/preview/image/library/124665?maxsize=512","Image Author":"Jeff Jeanes "},{"Scientific Name":"Euphrasia collina subsp. muelleri","Common Name":"Purple Eyebright, Mueller's Eyebright","Threatened status":"Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":16151,"Kingdom":"Plantae","Class":"Magnoliopsida","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=16151","Family":"Scrophulariaceae","Genus":"Euphrasia","Species":"collina","Description":"The Purple Eyebright is a semi-parasitic perennial herb growing up to 41 cm high (Barker 1999).","Image":"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/ImageHandler.ashx?graphicsId=43363&maxWidth=150","Image Author":"Colin Totterhall"},{"Scientific Name":"Ballantinia antipoda","Common Name":"Southern Shepherd's Purse","Threatened status":"Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":16173,"Kingdom":"Plantae","Class":"Magnoliopsida","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=16173","Family":"Brassicaceae","Genus":"Ballantinia","Species":"antipoda","Description":"The Southern Shepherd's Purse is a small annual plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.

The young stems are white with woolly hairs. The stems grow 10-40 cm long (Curtis 1963; Tas. DPIPWE 2003a). The leaves are stalkless, between 4-12 cm long and arranged alternately on the stem. They are crowded near the base of the stem and threadlike to almost flat with margins that are bent backwards. Both surfaces are covered in soft cotton like hairs that are white. The older leaves are persistent at the base of the stems (Curtis 1963; Tas.

Like other Galaxiidae, it has all soft-rayed fins, a body lacking scales, and a single dorsal fin positioned well back on the body. The body depth is greatest mid-abdomen, tapering to both head and tail, while the lateral line follows the dorsal profile. The head is short and blunt with large eyes, while the mouth is small, terminal and oblique, with jaws roughly equal in length. The dorsal and anal fins are opposite, shortbased and rounded. The caudal fin is long and rounded, with fleshy flanges extending forward almost to the bases of the dorsal and anal fins. A fleshy abdominal keel (more pronounced in males) extends from the pelvic fin base posteriorly to the vent. Body colour is olive-amber on the dorsal surface and sides, with a silvery-white belly, while the fins are transparent (Saddlier et al 2010).The species is sexually dimorphic (physical differences between the sexes), with males being smaller and more slender than females, and having three longitudinal black stripes along each side of the trunk, and a distinct orange stripe between the mid and lowest black stripe. The black stripes are less distinct or absent in females (Saddlier et al 2010). The Eastern Dwarf Galaxias is a mid-water, free-swimming species, and the entire life cycle is completed in freshwater. Only one year class has been observed, suggesting that the Eastern Dwarf Galaxias is an annual species (Saddlier et al 2010).","Image":"https://www.fishbase.se/images/thumbnails/jpg/tn_Gapus_m0.jpg","Image Author":"Kuiter Rudie"},{"Scientific Name":"Craterocephalus fluviatilis","Common Name":"Murray Hardyhead","Threatened status":"Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":56791,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Actinopterygii","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=56791","Family":"Atherinidae","Genus":"Craterocephalus","Species":"fluviatilis","Description":"The Murray Hardyhead is a small, moderately deep bodied fish which grows to a maximum length of 76 mm, but is commonly 40-65 mm.

The upperwings are mostly blue-black, with a prominent yellow shoulder-patch and red feathers on the inner secondary coverts and tertials; in flight, the red secondary coverts appear as a red band. The underbody is bright yellow except for the undertail, which is black. The underwings are bright yellow, contrasting with blackish flight feathers. The female has a similar pattern of plumage to the male, but appears duller: the head, neck and underparts are dull olive-green instead of bright yellow; the tail and flight feathers are dull bluish-green instead of blue-black; the shoulder-patch is duller greenish yellow; and the red markings on the wings are duller; and the underwings appear lime green instead of bright yellow (Higgins 1999).The Regent Parrot is usually seen in pairs or small flocks, but much larger flocks may congregate around abundant sources of food (Bedggood 1958; Morgan 1917; Sullivan 1967).

The rosette leaves are on leaf-stalks between 2 and 6 cm long, with leaf blades egg-shaped in outline, between 1 and 2.5 cm long and 1 to 2 cm wide. The leaves are entire or shallowly lobed; most commonly with 5 to 7 lobes and with scalloped margins. The leaf surface is minutely furry along the veins and near the edges. The flowering stems are to 15 cm tall, and terminate with an umbrella-like flower-cluster with 1 to 3 (and sometimes to 7) flowers that are borne on stalks between 1 and 2 cm long. The flowers have 5 petals that are wider at their tips than at their bases and are between 8 and 11 mm long. The flowers are in various shades of pale pink and each petal is marked with darker crimson or purple branching stripes that run down to the center of the flower. Flowers have 10 stamens. The fruit, 10 to 15 mm long, is a dry structure that splits into 5 segments. The fruit is elongated and shaped like a stork's bill, hence the plant's common name. Flowering is from October to March, with the peak flowering occurring in November and December. Seeds ripen and are shed about five weeks after flowering.","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Pelargonium_benambra.jpg/220px-Pelargonium_benambra.jpg","Image Author":"Melburnian"},{"Scientific Name":"Galaxias rostratus","Common Name":"Flathead Galaxias, Beaked Minnow, Flat-headed Galaxias, Flat-headed Jollytail, Flat-headed Minnow","Threatened status":"Critically Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":84745,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Actinopterygii","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=84745","Family":"Galaxiidae","Genus":"Galaxias","Species":"rostratus","Description":null,"Image":"https://fishesofaustralia.net.au/images/image/Galaxias%20rostratus%20Tarmo%20Raadik%20alt.jpg","Image Author":"Tarmo Raadik"},{"Scientific Name":"Limosa lapponica baueri","Common Name":"Bar-tailed Godwit (baueri), Western Alaskan Bar-tailed Godwit","Threatened status":"Vulnerable","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":86380,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Aves","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=86380","Family":"Scolopacidae","Genus":"Limosa","Species":"lapponica","Description":null,"Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Limosa_lapponica_2_-_Taren_Point.jpg/220px-Limosa_lapponica_2_-_Taren_Point.jpg","Image Author":"JJ Harrison"},{"Scientific Name":"Limosa lapponica menzbieri","Common Name":"Northern Siberian Bar-tailed Godwit, Bar-tailed Godwit (menzbieri)","Threatened status":"Critically Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":86432,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Aves","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=86432","Family":"Scolopacidae","Genus":"Limosa","Species":"lapponica","Description":null,"Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Limosa_lapponica_2_-_Taren_Point.jpg/220px-Limosa_lapponica_2_-_Taren_Point.jpg","Image Author":"JJ Harrison"},{"Scientific Name":"Commersonia prostrata","Common Name":"Dwarf Kerrawang","Threatened status":"Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":87152,"Kingdom":"Plantae","Class":"Magnoliopsida","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=87152","Family":"Malvaceae","Genus":"Commersonia","Species":"prostrata","Description":"The Dwarf Kerrawang is a prostrate, mat-forming shrub with trailing branches to 2 m long and ovate to cordate leaves 10-35 mm long and 5-25 mm wide, with serrate to crenate margins, the upper leaf surface is sparsely sprinkled with stellate hairs, more densely below, and the petiole is 3-20 mm long.
